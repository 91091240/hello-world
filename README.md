# hello-world
We will do this small activity to get used to github and familiar to coding.

Hi, my name is Julian and I am 15 years old. I have been in the STEAM program since the 6th grade, atleast that is what I was told, and I have liked to code as a hobby. I do not see myself as a programmer in the future although I know that the knowledge I have over coding now will definitely help me be an engineer.
